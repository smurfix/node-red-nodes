# Node-RED Nodes

A collection of nodes for [Node-RED](http://nodered.org). See below for a list.

## Installation

All of these nodes are available as individual npm packages. See the list below for the
npm package names, or [search npm](https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=node-red-node-).

This repository acts as an overall store for these nodes - and is not
intended as a way to install them - unless you really do want some development.

To install - either use the manage palette option in the editor, or change to your Node-RED user directory.

        cd ~/.node-red
        npm install node-red-node-{filename}

To manually install using this repo:

1. cd into the `nodes` directory of Node-RED
2. Either:
    - download the zip of the repository and extract it
    - run `git clone https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes.git`
3. run `npm install` in any of the node subfolders to install individual node's dependencies

## Running Tests

Node.js v6 or newer is required. To run tests on all of the nodes you will need the node-red runtime:

    npm i node-red-nodes
    npm test

## Contributing

Now that we support npm installation of nodes we recommend people post their own
nodes via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/). Please read the
[packaging guide notes](http://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/packaging.html).

For simple typos and single line fixes please just raise an issue pointing out
our mistakes. If you need to raise a pull request please read our
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before doing so.
